## Project Summary

ExtrAction is a simple chrome extension that uses a serverless architecture to obtain action items and summarize them into nice to-do lists. 

## Files Structure

The extension_bundle folder has all the files required to publish a Chrome Extension. In this bundle, popup.html and popup.js handle the look and behavior of our extension. An event is triggered when this option is clicked. The event fired is contained in the popup.js file. The popup.js file also has a fetch request that triggers our Google Cloud Function. It sends over the text of the email and returns a list of summarized action items (generated by our google cloud function).
